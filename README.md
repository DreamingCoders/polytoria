Polytoria 2022 (Client Scripts) is now Open Sourced! Under Free Use Clause
However you must use the Unity licenses that I will be providing.
Using the Polytoria source code without authorization of these licenses can lead to a Cease and Desist so please
do not go around publicly uploading it untill I have everything ready. That being said you are free to use VRC
for the time being, and if you use it I will let you use the client locally.
